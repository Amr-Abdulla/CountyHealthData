 * In the context of county health data, this graph could be used to:

1. Analyze the impact of smoking: The graph likely examines how cancer rates might change if smoking were eliminated, offering insights into the role smoking plays in health outcomes at the county level.
  
2. Identify high-risk counties: Counties with high smoking-related cancer rates could be flagged for health interventions and policy changes.
  
3. Support health policy recommendations: Understanding regional differences in smoking-related cancer rates can help target public health initiatives and smoking cessation programs to specific areas where they may have the greatest impact.
